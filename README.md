# sherpa-chess-problem

The problem is to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with dimensions M×N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. The colour of the piece does not matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.
As output, the program should list all the unique configurations to the console for which all of the pieces can be placed on the board without threatening each other.
